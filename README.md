## 📖 About This Assignment

This project is part of the **Scalyz 30 Days Job-Ready Challenge** — a public, community-driven assignment designed to push you beyond tutorials and into **real engineering work**.

All submissions are **public**.

- **Approved solutions** are **tagged** in the repository.
- **Current work** is visible in **open Pull Requests** with active discussions.

**Your role:** behave like a professional engineer — read existing discussions, learn from others, contribute ideas, and deliver your own solution.

---

## 💬 How to Participate

1. **Read ongoing discussions** in existing Pull Requests.
2. **Create issues** if you need help or spot potential improvements.
3. Ask for guidance **directly in the Scalyz community** or by commenting on PRs.
4. Submit your solution via Pull Request for review.

> 💡 This is a **public community assignment**.  
> The goal is for you to **experience the full engineering workflow**: reading requirements, collaborating, solving problems, and proving — to yourself and others — that you can do the job.

## 📝 Assignment Title

**Mission:** Automate the bootstrap of a fresh Ubuntu server, secure it, install core tools, deploy a sample containerized app, and ensure the process is **idempotent** and **repeatable**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Our fictional client is rolling out new apps across multiple environments.  
Their manual deployment process is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone.

They need **one reusable automation flow** that:

- Works on any fresh Ubuntu 24.04 server.
- Configures security and access.
- Deploys a containerized sample app.
- Can be re-run safely without breaking anything.

---

## ✅ Requirements

Your automation must:

- Create a dedicated user with `sudo` privileges and SSH key-based login.
- Disable root SSH login.
- Install and configure:
  - Docker (latest stable)
  - fail2ban for security monitoring
  - Log rotation for fail2ban and Docker logs
- Deploy a containerized sample app (provided or self-built).
- Configure log rotation and ensure logs remain clean.
- Be **idempotent** — multiple runs must not cause duplication or errors.

## 📦 Structure

You will work inside the provided repo structure:

```

infra-automation-challenge/
├── ansible/              # Or scripts/ if using Bash
│   ├── roles/
│   ├── playbooks/
│   └── vars/
├── docker/
│   └── app/
├── docs/
├── scripts/
└── tests/

```

---

## ⚙️ Constraints

- Use your own local VM or any free-tier cloud environment.
- No hardcoded environment-specific values or secrets.
- All configurable variables must be in one documented file.
- Automation must run **headless** (no manual prompts).

---

## 🔍 Evaluation Process

1. Submit a Pull Request to this repository.
2. **GitHub Actions** will:
   - Lint and validate syntax.
   - Check idempotency.
   - Verify the app is deployed and reachable.
3. **Community Review**:
   - At least 2 peers review your PR.
   - Feedback focuses on code quality, maintainability, security, and correctness.
4. **Approval & Tagging**:
   - Approved PRs are tagged and merged into the main branch.
